My name is Caspar van Lissa, an assistant professor of Methods & Statistics at Utrecht University and Open Science faculty ambassador for the [Open Science Community Utrecht](https://openscience-utrecht.com/). 

My [NWO Veni-funded research](https://www.nwo.nl/onderzoek-en-resultaten/onderzoeksprojecten/i/31/34231.html) focuses on predicting teenagers' emotional problems. Aside from my main research line on children's socio-emotional skills development, I contribute to several areas of research:

* Cooperation and morality, in collaboration with the [Oxford Morals Project](https://osf.io/w5ad8/) and [Amsterdam Cooperation Lab](https://amsterdamcooperationlab.com/)
* Climate and the environment
* Informative hypothesis evaluation
* Meta-analysis

I am a [prolific R-package developer](https://cjvanlissa.github.io/resume/#software) and contribute to 6 packages on CRAN, and 2 on GitHub.

As Open Science Ambassador to my faculty, I am committed to the philosophy of [Open Science](https://osf.io). Scientific progress is a cooperative effort, and transparency will allow us to derive more reliable insights.
